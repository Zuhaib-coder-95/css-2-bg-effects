        A flower, also known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the
        division Angiospermae). Flowers consist of a combination of vegetative organs sepals that enclose and protect the
        developing flower. These petals attract pollinators, and reproductive organs that produce gametophytes, which in
        flowering plants produce gametes. The male gametophytes, which produce sperm, are enclosed within pollen grains produced
        in the anthers. The female gametophytes are contained within the ovules produced in the ovary.
        
        Most flowering plants depend on animals, such as bees, moths, and butterflies, to transfer their pollen between
        different flowers, and have evolved to attract these pollinators by various strategies, including brightly colored,
        conspicuous petals, attractive scents, and the production of nectar, a food source for pollinators.[1] In this way, many
        flowering plants have co-evolved with pollinators to be mutually dependent on services they provide to one anotherâ€”in
        the plant's case, a means of reproduction; in the pollinator's case, a source of food.
